# The Myth of Sisyphus: Paper Boxes

If I could summarize the message of The Myth of Sisyphus in one main idea, it would be: hope is the ultimate human condition and it can survive any hardship. It is hope that give meaning to life, for the faithful it is paradise, for the prisoner it is freedom, and for all it is to live another day. This is when Albert Camus in his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, brings up the absurdity of suicide. This is from the theme of hope and absurdity that I based my game, Paper Boxes.

The gameplay is quite simple: the player must pack the books from the bookshelf into the cardboard box and then move the box into the moving truck. The trick is that every time the player lifts the box, it collapses, and all the books end on the floor. The box, in fact, never reaches the truck which only acts as a decoy for a goal. It is the unreachable exit to this endless loop; the door to a better place. The player must not give up on this “new life”, even if he has no guarantee of a brighter future. He can only hope for, imagine and work through this task. It is in every way similar to the punitive task given to Sisyphus by Zeus.

Why pack books? It is not required for survival, it is not the most useful item, and it is exhaustive to carry around. I see them as the sum of knowledge and experience we carry with us. In order to get out of the underworld, Sisyphus had to push the heavy rock to the top of the mountain hoping that it will get to the other side and, in order to move out, the player has to carry the weight of his life experience hoping it will reach the truck. On one side there is the weight of past mistakes and, on the other, the weight of knowledge we acquired with age. In both cases, the burden is the weight of life experience.

The game is absurd not because of its goal, but because of its purpose. Making a game no one can ever win is absurd. It would even be natural to question if it is a game at all. In Paper Boxes there is no score, not even to count the attempts at completing the task. I wonder for how long the player will consider it fun or how many times will he try before actually believing that there is no winning condition. But maybe he will still believe that there is a way to win even if he can’t prove it, that the hundredth time will be the one. This faithfulness in a favourable outcome is the essence of the Sisyphean story. It is also the essence of the journey of life, to progress toward a goal we can only believe in.
