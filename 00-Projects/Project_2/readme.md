# #CAPTIONme

James Bridle's essay, [Something is Wrong on the Internet]( https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2), surveys the unpredictability of the Internet. The dark and twisted content on the Internet is the simple result of mixing the deviant nature of human beings with of the anonymity and freedom of expression of the Web. However, when children are the target of such material, the profitability of the practice is at the expense of their naivety. We can therefore question the morality of the platforms that are providing sensitive content. Even if they are not doing so intentionally, it does not excuse responsibility. What stroke me in the examples, beside the inherent strangeness, is the messages hidden behind cute things. Namely the Little Baby Bum’s *Nursery Rhymes: Sleeping Bunnies* has some unexpected lyrics: “they’re so still, are they ill?’. *The Finger Family Song* by ChuChuTV puts a slight emphasis on the brother, the middle finger, by changing his lyrics from the other finger family members. Instead of saying like the dad: “I’m thumb, I’m thumb. How do you do?”, he says “Middle finger, middle finger. Now you know me.” It is the kind of suggestive instances that inspired #CAPTIONme. This program is about slightly modifying the meaning of inoffensive subjects into evocative matter to disturb the audience. In this case, the “naïve one” is the user, the “immoral” or “irresponsible one” is the platform, Instagram, and the disapproving audience is the artificial behavior of likes and followers. In this game, you cannot win. Instagram basically bullies you by altering your captions without your consent, prohibiting you to get social acknowledgment. The images published gets negative or disturbing connotations. The emerging sense of powerlessness is to mimic the one parents may feel from not being able to trust platforms like Youtube for kids’ entertainment. It is not a simple task to change the nature of the Internet, in front of such a problem there are only two options: to boycott or to accept its inner characteristics, good and bad. That’s why it is impossible to win this game.

 Briefly, social media is against you, then other users turn against you, and still, it is benefiting from your behavior since it records secretly your reactions. Anything you say after posting the caption can be recorded and added to the comments. This game is fundamentally a commentary on social media/streaming video platforms, their flaws and their responsibility. The counter example is its mean.
