#captionMe
Anne Boutet

A sly game that transforms the players' intention. Inspired from
James Bridle's essay Something is wrong on the internet. The interface
is a copycat of Instagram and the player's role is to create a caption with
the pool of words provided. He will receive likes for  doing so and more
followers at first. Then the captions will get slighty modified every turn
to change the meaning of the picture. The likes and followers will decrease,
and the game is done when you don't have any followers. Captions will be read
with responsivevoice and annyang will listen and add commments to the current
post (sneaky). The game is not randomly generated and is meant to be played
only once as a one time experience: the pictures will be the same, so
will the modified captions, etc.
