# Computational Wizard Duel
For this last project, I must admit that I struggled to find an idea. With the beginning COVID-19 pandemic, I felt trapped because I usually get my ideas by wandering around. Making an interactive program about the pandemic or my confinement was not conclusive, and I did not want to be too literal about it. I noticed, however, how my need for escape tainted my musical, cinematic, and literary interests with fantasy. This concept of a computational wizard duel is the simple coincidence of me searching for an idea while listening to the Harry Potter’s movie soundtrack. I though that it would be fun to define the keyboard as a wand and computer functions as spells in a classic tur-by-turn fight. So I started by creating spells like “Send Virus to Hard Drive” or “Frozen Screen”. However, I was not making a statement with this game, it was not the result of a well thought concept like I usually aim too do. This game was a challenge because it was something different from what I usually do. This wizard/programmer notion reminded me of the first class of CART253 when I felt like making a circle appear in a browser was like doing magic. This playful approach allowed me to focus more on the JavaScript programming rather than on the overall appearance of the program – still I spent too much time aligning thing perfectly, baby steps… baby steps. It helped me to push my understanding of JavaScript further and now I finally get how to use the parameters of a function and how objects are truly useful.

As for the game itself, I wanted to do a multiplayer duel. I thought of making it work with one player first, and made all the structure in that way. When I finished the structure, I soon realized that if I only had only one player now, the second player had to choose its spell himself – I have this weird tendency to want to make AI programs, like I know how to. Well, to rebuild a structure for a second player would have been too long for I only had a couple days ahead of myself. I then made the second player choose a spell randomly among different spell books depending on its battery power (health power) or the player one’s battery power. Now that the game works fine, I realize that the player’s opponent is pretty hard to defeat. I need to add more spells with powerful effects that need to be used strategically to win. I am happy that this game requires more strategy than luck because I was scared that it would not be fun to play.

As of now, *Computational Wizard Duel* is not fully done. I want to add more spells and graphics. Plus, it would be great for it to have levels or different opponents (the opponent changes name when the game restart, but it does not change the gameplay). I think this game has the potential to be developed into something more complex, and so, more fun. I intend to keep working on it.
